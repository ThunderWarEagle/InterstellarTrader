To use these scripts, ou will need to open the scripts starting with the prefix app_*. 
Each script has a number of parameters, most of the self explanatory. Change the parameters and 
run the script (using IDLE for instance Module/Run, or F5 on Windows).

The files called lib_* shouldn't be touched unless you really know what you are doing. 

Random tables are encoded as simple text files in the tables folder. Look for examples and replicate.

Systems are clunkily described at the moment. I'll get a fix for this soon enough. 

This code was written using Python 2.7. It probably will complain with Python 3.X. I hope that I cared 
enough to test the code and probably will soon.
